# Getting Set Up

Before we get started with Swift for app development, we have to download Xcode.

1. [Download Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12/) to your Mac \(running High Sierra or Sierra\) from the Mac App Store.
2. Once Xcode has downloaded, open it.
3. If you are prompted to install additional components for Xcode, click Install and enter the password for an administrator on the machine.

4. In the dialog that appears, select Create a new Xcode project.

5. Choose the Single View App template from the resulting dialog.

6. Give your app a name:

And now we're good to go, we have the start of our app, and we'll begin tinkering.
