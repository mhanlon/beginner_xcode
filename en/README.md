# Beginning Xcode

These sushi cards will take you through setting up your Mac for app development with Swift. The primary objective is to become familiar with the Xcode interface, which is what you will use to build apps for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

After completing these cards you will have an app that displays a photo.
